#### peConnect is a social networking website that is custom made to tackle the requiremens of the PEC member and their needs from a social networking website as a student, faculty, official. peConnect provides an custom made platform for PEC members to communicate their ideas and share important events that can effect all or any subset of our society!

## Implementation
<li>We have used MongoDB as our NoSQL database to  store user info and chats</li>
<li>We have used socket.io to implement chat feature</li>
<li>We have used Pug which is a template engine that allows us to inject data and then produce HTML</li>

## Things to remember
<li>Due to security reasons of PEC wifi , the Webpage is not able to connect with MonggoDb</li>
<li>So Please connect to personal network </li>

## Usage
<li> peConnect is to be used by each and every member of PEC so that they can communicate and discuss various ideas and concepts and learn about their interests</li>
<li> Direct communication with all PEC members ad no hassle to share everywhere</li>
